      "description": "magine That: Rehearsing Futures of Equity and Joy invites educators and industry professionals to radically reimagine design, technology, and learning through the lens of justice-centered imagination. Drawing on Black feminist thought, Afrofuturism, and social justice computing research, this keynote explores what equity sounds like, tastes like, and feels like when it becomes the norm—not the exception. Anchored in academic studies such as the counterstory-driven practices of Black Sims modders and the critical consciousness fostered through social justice informatics curricula, the presentation highlights how marginalized communities aren’t merely resisting exclusion—they are building joyful, pluriversal futures—creating technologies that celebrate multiple ways of being rather than forcing universal conformity. It calls on technologists and educators to move beyond harm-reduction toward design that centers joy, collaboration, and cultural specificity. Grounded in Black feminist thought and Afrofuturist traditions from Octavia Butler to Ruha Benjamin, this keynote emphasizes imagination as both theory and praxis, urging audiences to view justice not just as a goal, but as a design principle. The talk culminates with a challenge: what would it look like if equity were embedded in every line of code, classroom discussion, and organizational value? Imagine that—and then see to it.",

Workshop attendees will participate as students to engage in parts of a history lesson and see examples from project’s online platform created by our team that integrates CODAP (https://codap.concord.org/) and other tools. The history lesson draws inspiration from W.E.B. Du Bois’ data visualizations and invites students to examine the impact of the Voting Rights Act on U.S. elections, including unpacking the justice visions of historical figures who used data, ways data visualizations were received, and how data speaks to pivotal social issues around systemic, racial inequities. After the lesson, participants will engage in a group discussion about ways to weave data science into historical contexts. Finally, initial findings from a pilot of this unit will be shared.",
