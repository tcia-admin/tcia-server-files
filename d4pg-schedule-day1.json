In this session, we will share our experiences as we developed and delivered this as an education studies class in the spring of 2025.  In the class, we examined how “carcerality” is an organizing feature of public education in the U.S. by exploring disciplinary processes, technology, and surveillance practices, curricular norms, and the built environment in schools, as well as attempts to challenge such carceral logics, especially through organized efforts of communities of color. \n\nGoal: Introduce syllabus and opportunities to deliver classes at schools and in the community.  This session will highlight, readings, activities, project work and resources to successfully deliver this curriculum. \"",

In this intimate, story driven session, we will explore how the pursuit of convenience and automation is quietly disconnecting us from each other, and how reclaiming small moments of presence can be a radical act of justice, care, and community building.\n\nThrough personal storytelling, audience reflection, and real world examples from Denmark’s slow checkout lanes to AI supported classrooms, this session invites us to imagine a world where technology serves humanity, not replaces it. We will examine who gets erased first when people are removed from design, why connection must be the foundation of any just future, and how AI, when used intentionally, can return time to our lives rather than steal it.\n\nParticipants will leave not with a to do list, but with a question:\n\nWhat small, beautiful moment will you choose to protect?\n\nThis session is for anyone who cares about digital justice, ethical technology, and the quiet power of being human together.\""

      "description": "Based on examples from the book Access Is Capture: How Edtech Reproduces Racial Inequality, this presentation will focus on data-intensive education technology (edtech) and how its use contributes to surveillance abuse. While the evidence of the value of edtech to contemporary learning is exaggerated, many very real harms related to surveillance abuse have been underreported. Based on the work of community organizers active in anti-surveillance and youth movements, I propose a few questions schools, parents, and education professionals of all kinds might ask before incorporating edtech into classroom learning.",
